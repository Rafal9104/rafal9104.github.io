# Project Richmond
> Project Richmond is a website of fictional football team AFC Richmond from AppleTV show called "Ted Lasso". In my version, this team plays in non-league level, which explains why their website doesn't look like websites of big Premier League clubs. This project is my first website ever created.
Main page have logo and navigation menu at the top. Pages that you can visit are: Home (main page), Scores and Table, Team, Tickets and Contact Us. If you scroll down the main page you'll see layouts with News and Articles, organized as three column layout. At the bottom there is a footer which consists links to social media platforms.
Scores and Table page, allows user to check updated league table, latest scores and upcoming games, with dates and time.
Team page consist an image and and list of team members with important information about every player.
Tickets page allows you to sign up for membership, with informations about ticket prices.
Contact Us page allow user to send feedback.

### Logo

### Navigation menu
- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp) - I have used this tutorial to create my navigation bar
### News and Articles Section
- After trying few solutions, as how to create news and articles layout (such as creating ordered list or unordered list with images), I decided to create a gallery with description text. I've tried to make it look like sport websites with news, for example BBC Sport. This w3schools tutorial was used (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp)
- I had an idea to create "more news" and "more articles" hyperlinks at the right side of the page. Hyperlink though, caused to move image in the gallery, so eventually I decided to use "News" and "Articles" headings as a hyperlinks.
- I found an inspiration on hover transition here (https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-hover-animation#:~:text=A%20CSS%20hover%20animation%20occurs,to%20enhance%20your%20site's%20interactivity.)
